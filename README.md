# TriviaGame

This game uses html, javascript, css, and jQuery to create a one-page trivia game that changes appearance and content based on user input and javascript setInterval/setTimeout functions.  

I was not particularly concerned with the number of questions since they can easily be added/removed from the game object while leaving 
the rest of the code the same.  In other words, I was more concerned with the framework and functionality than the theme or the content.
